This project is a Java-based RSS Aggregator that reads a custom XML file containing multiple RSS v2.0 feed URLs and generates formatted HTML pages for each feed. Each output page displays a table of news items with titles linked to their sources. Additionally, the program creates an index HTML page with a list of all feeds for easy navigation. The project emphasizes modular design using static methods, XMLTree parsing, and structured HTML generation, providing a hands-on introduction to XML processing, RSS technology, and automated content formatting in Java.
